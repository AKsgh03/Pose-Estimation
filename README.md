# Pose-Estimation
This project focuses on real-time human pose estimation using Mediapipe and OpenCV. It captures live video feed and detects key body landmarks to analyze joint movements. 
 A custom function calculates the angles between joints (such as the shoulder, elbow, and wrist) to monitor specific exercises. The project also includes a bicep curl counter, which tracks repetitions based on joint angles and provides visual feedback on the stage of the exercise. The system is designed to help users perform and track their movements more accurately during workouts.
